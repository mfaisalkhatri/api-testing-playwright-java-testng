## :question: What is this Repository about?

This project is the outcome of my self-learning about the API Testing Automation framework - [Playwright with Java](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api-testing#writing-api-test)

## :briefcase: What does this repo contain?
- This repo contains example codes of API Tests using Playwright with Java.
- [TestNG](https://testng.org) is used as Test Runner and for performing assertions in the test.
- `Log4j` is used to capture logs.
- [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) has been used to generate Getter and Setters automatically for post body requests.
- FAKE Rest APIs on [Reqres.in](https://reqres.in/) has been used for testing.
- End to End scenarios have been added for the [restful booker APIs](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html).
- Happy and Sad Path Scenarios have been added for the [restful-ecommerce APIs](https://github.com/mfaisalkhatri/restful-ecommerce)

## :hammer_and_wrench: Talking more about the Scenarios Covered in this project:

- How to use `Lombok` to generate `Getters` and `Setters`?
- How to use `Lombok` for writing the builder pattern code?
- How to use Builder Pattern for test data generation using [Data Faker](https://github.com/datafaker-net/datafaker)?
- How to write end-to-end api tests?
- How to write Happy Path scenarios for the APIs?
- How to write Sad Path scenarios for the APIs?
