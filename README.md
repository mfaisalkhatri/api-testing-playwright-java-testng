## :question: What is this Repository about?

This project is the outcome of my self-learning about the API Testing Automation framework - [Playwright with Java](https://playwright.dev/java/docs/api-testing#writing-api-test)

## :briefcase: What does this repo contain?
- This repo contains example codes of API Tests using Playwright with Java.
- [TestNG](https://testng.org) is used as Test Runner and for performing assertions in the test.
- `Log4j` is used to capture logs.
- [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) has been used to generate Getter and Setters automatically for post body requests.
- FAKE Rest APIs on [Reqres.in](https://reqres.in/) has been used for testing.
- End to End scenarios have been added for the [restful booker APIs](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html).
